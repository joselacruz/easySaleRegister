# EasySaleRegister
## Description
EasySaleRegister is a web application designed to help you register the products you want to sell. The app allows you to enter product details such as title, product URL, price, sales price, description, and images. Data is stored in Firebase, and images are uploaded using the [ImgBB](https://imgbb.com/) API

This app is in a beta phase and is primarily designed for personal use. Currently, it is not possible to share product links with potential customers. The functionality focuses on internal product management, which allows you to manage products in sales, including the purchase and sale price.
